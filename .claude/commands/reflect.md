# Reflect

Your reflection system. Uses a two-step decision tree with `AskUserQuestion` for native scroll-and-select UI.

## Quick Start

If the user types `/reflect` with additional context, detect intent and route:
- **Reading intent** (mentions an article, URL, [[Note Title]], or "read/discuss"): skip the menu and go to Read & Discuss using their input as the article to read.
- **Meeting intent** (mentions "meeting", "standup", "1:1", or "meeting notes"): skip the menu and dispatch the **Meeting** agent directly.
- **Talk/transcript intent** (mentions "seminar", "talk", "transcript", "podcast", "video" or pastes a large block of transcript text): skip the menu and go to Read & Discuss, with Reader preprocessing the transcript format.
- **Reflection intent** (everything else, e.g., "/reflect I had a tough day"): skip the menu and go straight to Daily Reflection using their input as context.

## Step 1: Choose Mode

Use `AskUserQuestion` with these options:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Reflect** | Think about what's happening — daily reflection, weekly review, or explore connections |
| 2 | **Plan** | Make decisions and set direction — goal review, decision journal, or energy audit |
| 3 | **Act** | Do something with your notes — compact, deep dive, or triage |
| 4 | **Read** | Read and discuss an article or note with structured reading lenses |
| 5 | **Learn** | Get recommendations or introspect to rebuild your self-model |

## Step 2: Choose Action

Based on Step 1, use a second `AskUserQuestion`:

### If Reflect:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Daily Reflection** | Reflect on today's notes and recent thinking |
| 2 | **Weekly Review** | Energy + attention audit for the past week |
| 3 | **Explore** | Surface forgotten connections and open threads |

- **Daily Reflection:** Continue with the Daily Reflection flow below
- **Weekly Review:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/weekly.md`
- **Explore:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/explore.md`

### If Plan:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Goal Review** | Check progress on goals — progressing, neglected, or shifted |
| 2 | **Decision Journal** | Structured decision-making with framework cross-validation |
| 3 | **Energy Audit** | Four-dimension energy assessment (physical, mental, emotional, social) |

- **Goal Review:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/review.md`
- **Decision Journal:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/decision.md`
- **Energy Audit:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/energy-audit.md`

### If Act:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Curate Inbox** | Goal-aware triage of your Readwise inbox — score, route, and tag |
| 2 | **Compact Notes** | Find and merge redundant or overlapping notes |
| 3 | **Deep Dive** | Full briefing on a topic — notes + web research + resources + framework, 4 agents in parallel |
| 4 | **Note Triage** | Scan for compaction candidates across your notes |
| 5 | **Process Meeting** | Turn a work meeting transcript into structured notes with action items |

- **Curate Inbox:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/curate.md`
- **Compact Notes:** Ask the user what topic or notes to compact. Then run the snapshot-first flow (see `protocols/orchestrator.md` → Note Operations → Compact Notes):
  1. **Researcher** identifies related notes in `zk/` (semantic.py primary, Grep for structural).
  2. **Orchestrator snapshots each source** to `zk/cache/compact-<slug>-<n>.md` — local `cp` for files under `zk/`, `get_note()` fallback only for notes genuinely missing from the local mirror.
  3. Dispatch to **Curator** with `snapshot_paths: [...]` in the handoff. The Curator works exclusively from the snapshot files, runs the Content Preservation Checklist, and returns a draft.
  4. User approves each output note individually before Curator writes.
- **Deep Dive:** Ask the user for a topic, then dispatch **four agents in parallel**:
  1. **Researcher** — search all notes related to this topic (what you've already thought/written)
  2. **Scout** — search the web for recent articles, research, and developments on this topic
  3. **Librarian** — find curated resources to deepen understanding (books, papers, courses)
  4. **Thinker** — select and apply a relevant framework from `frameworks/`
  Once all four return, **Synthesizer** combines their outputs into a unified briefing: your existing thinking, external intelligence, curated resources, and a framework lens — all in one view. Present in Chinese for reading-intensive output. Before write-back (if any), dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel to verify citation accuracy and Scout-sourced claims.
- **Note Triage:** Ask the user for 3-5 topic areas (or pull from `profile/identity.md` themes). Dispatch the **Researcher** to search each topic area in parallel. For each area, identify notes with overlapping content. Present a prioritized compaction plan: which notes to merge, estimated redundancy, and impact. The user picks which to compact, then dispatch to **Curator** for each approved merge.
- **Process Meeting:** Ask the user to paste or provide the meeting transcript. Dispatch the **Meeting** agent (Executive mode — action items, decisions, next steps). Present the structured output. Before saving, dispatch **Challenger** to check: are action items attributed correctly? Are any decisions ambiguous or missing owners? Ask the user if they want to save as a Reflect note — if yes, dispatch **Curator** to create it. For research talks or presentations, use Read instead — Reader handles transcript format with real analytical lenses.

### If Read:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Read & Discuss** | Quick read + interactive discussion (default) |
| 2 | **Focused Read** | Pick 1-2 specific lenses to focus on |
| 3 | **Multi-Lens Read** | Read with all 4 lenses in parallel — full analysis |

- **Read & Discuss:** Ask for the article/note. Dispatch 1 Reader (Critical lens) + 1 Researcher (find related notes). Present the analysis, then enter interactive discussion mode. Before write-back, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel to verify accuracy, then create a standalone article note (see Article Note step below). This is the lightweight default — most reading sessions start here.
- **Focused Read:** Ask the user which article/note and which lens(es): Critical, Structural, Practical, or Dialectical. Dispatch 1-2 Reader instances with the chosen lenses. Reader automatically handles transcript format (video/podcast) with preprocessing before applying the lens. Before write-back, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel to verify accuracy, then create a standalone article note (see Article Note step below). Use when the user knows what angle they want.
- **Multi-Lens Read:** Ask the user which article or note to read. Then follow the Reading Hub flow below. Use for important articles worth deep multi-angle analysis.

#### Reading Hub Flow (Multi-Lens Read)

1. **Parallel dispatch — Phase 1 (gather + read):**
   - 2-4x **Reader** instances, each with a different lens. Always include Critical + Structural. Add by content type:
     - Opinion/journalism/essays → + Dialectical (find the tensions)
     - How-to/research/strategy → + Practical (extract takeaways)
     - Philosophy/argument/debate → + Dialectical + Practical
     - Video/podcast transcripts → Critical + Practical (Reader auto-preprocesses transcript format)
   - **Researcher** — find user's existing notes related to the topic
   - **Scout** (1-2 instances) — gather external context on the topic
   - **Thinker** — select and apply a relevant framework

2. **Convergence — Phase 2 (synthesize):**
   - **Synthesizer** combines all Reader briefs + Researcher + Scout + Thinker into a unified reading report
   - Present the report in Chinese (reading-intensive)

3. **Discussion — Phase 3 (interact):**
   - Enter interactive discussion mode
   - User and orchestrator discuss the article, guided by the multi-lens analysis
   - Dispatch additional Reader instances with specific lenses if the user wants to go deeper on an aspect

4. **Quality gate — Phase 4 (review + challenge):**
   - Before write-back, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel:
     - Reviewer checks: citation accuracy, grounding, honesty
     - Challenger checks: are we asking the right questions? What did we miss?
   - Fix any issues they surface before presenting the write-back

5. **Article note — Phase 5 (create standalone note):**
   - Before write-back, create a standalone article note in Reflect using `create_note` with:
     - Title: the article's title
     - Body: source URL, author, publication date, and key data points / takeaways from the reading analysis
     - Tags: `#article` and relevant topic tags
   - This note becomes the canonical reference for this article in the user's knowledge graph.

6. **Write-back — Phase 6 (with approval):**
   - Present proposed write-back to user for approval
   - Include [[backlinks]] to the article note created in Phase 5 and any related notes discussed
   - No provenance tag. Write-backs are alloy by default (see `protocols/epistemic-hygiene.md`). Topic tags are fine. The descriptive heading is the duplicate-detection signal, not a tag.

#### Article Note (all reading flows)

For **all** reading session types (Read & Discuss, Focused Read, Multi-Lens Read), create a standalone article note before the write-back:

1. Use `create_note` with the article's title as the note title
2. Include in the body: source URL, author, publication date, and key data points / takeaways
3. Tag with `#article` and relevant topic tags (e.g., `#ai`, `#career`, `#systems`)
4. Backlink to this note from the daily note write-back using [[Article Title]]

This ensures every article read has a permanent, searchable reference in Reflect's knowledge graph.

### If Learn:

| Option | Label | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Recommend Resources** | Get reading/learning recommendations on a topic (Chinese summaries) |
| 2 | **Introspect** | Rebuild your self-model — discover identity, taste, curiosity, and directions from your notes |

- **Recommend Resources:** Dispatch to the **Librarian** agent. Ask the user what topic they want recommendations for. The Librarian searches existing notes for context, then recommends books, papers, articles, and other resources with Chinese summaries.
- **Introspect:** Read and follow `.claude/commands/introspect.md`

---

# Daily Reflection

Run a reflection session grounded in your Reflect notes and goals.

## Prerequisites

1. Check if `profile/identity.md` exists. If not, tell the user: "No profile found. Run `/introspect` first to build your self-model." and stop.
2. Read `profile/identity.md`. Check the `Last built:` date. If older than 7 days, warn: "Your profile is stale (built on [date]). Consider running `/introspect` to refresh. Continuing with current profile."

**Protocols used in this session:** `protocols/session-continuity.md` (connecting sessions), `protocols/integration.md` (insight → action), `protocols/contradiction-detection.md` (surfacing contradictions in Step 3), `protocols/epistemic-hygiene.md` (write-first nudge in warm-up, provenance tagging in write-back).

## Context Loading

1. **Read profile files:**
   - `profile/identity.md` — your self-model and intellectual taste
   - `profile/directions.md` — your goals and directions

2. **Read recent reflections** (last 3 files from `zk/reflections/` directory, sorted by date). If none exist, this is the first session — note that.

3. **Pull fresh context from the local mirror:**
   - `Read zk/daily-notes/<today>.md` — what you've done today. If the file is missing or visibly truncated (today's capture hasn't synced yet), fall through to `get_daily_note(date: "<today>")` via MCP.
   - `Read zk/daily-notes/<yesterday>.md` — what you did yesterday. Local only; no MCP fallback needed for a sync-complete day.
   - For recent activity related to your themes, run `Bash: scripts/semantic.py query "<theme>" --after "<7 days ago, YYYY-MM-DD>" --top 5` first — this is the primary content lookup. For structural follow-up (exact strings, known tags), list files modified in the last 7 days with `Bash: find zk/daily-notes zk/reflections -type f -name "*.md" -mtime -7 2>/dev/null | sort`, then `Grep` the theme keyword across those paths.

## Coaching Session

Based on the loaded context, run an interactive reflection:

### 0. Continuity Check (if not the first session)
If a previous reflection exists in `zk/reflections/`, read the most recent one. Follow `protocols/session-continuity.md` — one brief callback, then move forward:
- If the previous session has a "Next Action" and it was from a **different day**: check in gently per `protocols/integration.md`.
- If the previous session was **today**: skip the check-in (don't nag on multiple sessions per day).
- If there was no prior action: skip this step entirely.

### 1. Warm-Up: Adaptive Opening
Choose opening style based on what you find in the daily note:

| What you find | Opening style |
|---|---|
| User wrote something specific today | Reflect it back: "I see you wrote about [X]..." |
| User had a big day (many entries) | Acknowledge the energy: "Busy day — what stood out most?" |
| User wrote very little or nothing | Go to yesterday or last session: "Last time we talked about [X]. How has that been sitting?" |
| A contradiction with a past note | Lead with curiosity: "Something interesting — in [[Old Note]] you said X, but today..." |
| A neglected goal is relevant | Gentle nudge: "I notice [[Goal]] hasn't come up recently..." |

Don't ask a question yet in the warm-up — just ground the conversation.

### 2. Reflective Questions (2-3, one at a time)
Use the Challenger's question taxonomy for depth:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| First question | **Mirror/Surface** — clarify what's on their mind |
| Second question | **Structural** — examine an assumption or connect to a goal |
| Third question | **Paradigmatic/Generative** — open new possibility or challenge a belief |

Each question should:
- Reference a specific note or goal by title in [[brackets]]
- Connect current activity to longer-term patterns or goals
- Be open-ended (not yes/no)
- Match the user's language (Chinese for Chinese goals)

### 3. Forgotten Connection (Semantic Discovery)
Use `Bash: scripts/semantic.py query "<concept>" --before "<3 months ago, YYYY-MM-DD>" --top 10` to find a semantically related note the user may have forgotten. Reframe and retry if thin — Phase C removed the `search_notes` escape hatch.
- Search with a concept from the conversation, not just keywords
- Go back at least 3 months for genuine surprise
- Present as a provocation, not a summary:
  "This reminds me of something you wrote in [[old note title]] — '[brief quote]'. Do you see a connection?"

### 4. Framework Application (Optional — delegate to Thinker)
If a clear pattern emerged during the conversation, dispatch to the **Thinker** agent:
- The Thinker selects and applies a framework from `frameworks/` using its decision tree
- Present the Thinker's insight as an "orient" perspective: "Looking at this through [framework]..."
- This is the Orient phase — contextualizing raw observations against mental models

### 5. Close with Concrete Prompt
One specific, actionable next step tied to a goal. Not generic advice — something the user can do today or this week.

## Output

After the interactive session, write a reflection file:

**File:** `zk/reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md`
```markdown
# Reflection — YYYY-MM-DD

## Context
[Brief summary of what was discussed, with note citations]

## Key Insights
[Bullet points of insights from the conversation]

## Connections Made
[Notes or themes that were connected during the session]

## Next Action
[The concrete prompt or action suggested]

## Notes Referenced
[List of all notes cited during this session, as [[Note Title]] links]

## Session Meta
- User engagement: high / medium / low
- Questions that landed: [which questions got thoughtful responses]
- Surprise factor: yes / no [did we surface something genuinely new?]
```

## Session Log

After writing the reflection file, emit a session log to `zk/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md` following `protocols/session-log.md`. Populate from data accumulated during the session: agent dispatches (from handoff tracking), search log (from Researcher handoffs and direct searches), gate results (from Reviewer handoffs), questions and engagement (from Challenger handoffs and your own questions), frameworks applied (from Thinker handoffs), continuity data (from step 0 and step 5), routing decisions, anomalies, and harness assumptions exercised. This is a local file write only. No MCP call. No user approval needed. If the write fails, warn and continue.

## Write-Back to Reflect

After writing the reflection file, check if today's daily note already contains a write-back from today's session. Detect by descriptive heading (the heading is the signal, not a tag). As a best-effort fallback, also check for the legacy `#ai-reflection` tag in case earlier in the day something pre-Phase-A wrote using the old convention.

- If **a write-back already exists**: Skip. Tell the user: "Already wrote to today's daily note earlier. Skipping duplicate write-back."

- If **no write-back exists yet**: Before presenting the write-back, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel to verify citation accuracy, framing, and tone. Fix any issues they surface. Then **ask the user for approval before writing.** Present the proposed write-back and wait for confirmation. Do not auto-write. **Write-backs are always in English**, even if the session was conducted in Chinese. The write-back should follow this format:
  ```
  ## [Descriptive Title]
  [2-3 sentence summary of key insights from today's reflection session]
  Related: [[Note Title 1]] [[Note Title 2]]
  ```
  **Title guidelines:** The heading must describe the session's core theme or question, not its source. Titles are in English (same as the write-back body). Good examples:
  - Topic-based: `Constraint creates meaning`
  - Question-based: `Why does unlimited freedom feel empty?`
  - Date+theme: `03/15 Energy dip and recovery patterns`
  - Insight-based: `Delegation as a trust signal`

  Never use generic titles like "AI Reflection" or "Daily Reflection Summary." The descriptive heading is load-bearing: it is the duplicate-detection signal and the only visible marker of a session write-back in the daily note. **No provenance tag.** Write-backs are alloy by default (see `protocols/epistemic-hygiene.md`). Topic tags are fine when they describe subject matter.

  Include [[backlinks]] to all notes referenced during the session so they appear in Reflect's backlink graph. Use today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format.

## Wrap Up

Tell the user the reflection has been saved.
