# Energy Audit

Deep assessment of where your energy goes — physical, mental, emotional, and social. Identifies energy drains and sources to optimize for sustainable high performance.

## Prerequisites

1. Read `profile/identity.md` for context.
2. Read `profile/directions.md` for #energy category goals.

## Context Loading

1. **Read the last 14 daily notes from the local vault** to track energy patterns: `Read $ZK/daily-notes/<today>.md` back through `Read $ZK/daily-notes/<14-days-ago>.md` (one `Read` per date). For dates missing from the vault, report the gap.
2. **Search for energy-related notes:**
   - `Grep(pattern: "累|疲惫|精力", path: "$ZK/")` — Chinese exhaustion markers (local, exact).
   - `Grep(pattern: "运动|健康|睡眠", path: "$ZK/")` — Chinese health markers (local, exact).
   - `Grep(pattern: "exercise|health|sleep", path: "$ZK/")` — English health markers (local, exact).
   - `Bash: uv run scripts/semantic.py query "tired exhausted drained" --top 10` — **primary** for affective states that may not use literal "tired/exhausted" language. Reframe the concept and retry if results are thin.

## The Four Energy Dimensions

### 1. Physical Energy
- Sleep quality and quantity
- Exercise frequency
- Nutrition patterns
- Illness or physical complaints
- Weight/fitness trajectory

### 2. Mental Energy
- Focus and concentration quality
- Learning vs. routine work ratio
- Cognitive load from context-switching
- Creative output vs. administrative tasks

### 3. Emotional Energy
- Relationship quality (energizing vs. draining interactions)
- Stress sources
- Joy sources
- Unresolved conflicts or anxieties

### 4. Social Energy
- Introvert/extrovert battery level
- Quality of professional relationships
- Community connection
- Isolation signals

## Energy Matrix

Present findings as:

| Dimension | Sources (+) | Drains (-) | Net Trend |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Physical | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Mental | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Emotional | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Social | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |

## Coaching Questions

1. "Which dimension is most depleted right now?"
2. "What's one energy drain you could eliminate this week?"
3. "What energizes you that you're not doing enough of?"
4. "Is any goal consuming disproportionate energy relative to its importance?" (Apply Pareto)

## Energy Matrix
[Matrix table from above]

## Key Findings
- [Finding 1 with evidence from notes]
- [Finding 2 with evidence from notes]

## Energy Drains to Address
1. [Drain] — Impact: high/medium/low — Action: [specific]
2. [Drain] — Impact: high/medium/low — Action: [specific]

## Energy Sources to Protect
1. [Source] — currently at risk because [reason]
2. [Source] — underutilized, could increase by [how]

## Recommendations
- This week: [one small change]
- This month: [one structural change]

- Surprise factor: yes / no
```

## Session Log

After writing the energy audit file, emit a session log:
1. `Bash: uv run scripts/session_log.py --type energy-audit --duration <minutes>`
2. `Edit` the created file to populate sections from session data (agents dispatched, searches, questions, frameworks, anomalies). See `reflect.md` Session Log for the full fill-in guide. Leave empty sections with headers only. If the write fails, warn and continue.

## Wrap Up

The energy audit file in `$ZK/reflections/` is the durable session output. Daily notes are user-authored; the system reads them but does not modify them. Tell the user the audit has been saved and where to find it.
