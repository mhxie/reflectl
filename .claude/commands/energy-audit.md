# Energy Audit

Deep assessment of where your energy goes — physical, mental, emotional, and social. Identifies energy drains and sources to optimize for sustainable high performance.

## Prerequisites

1. Read `profile/identity.md` for context.
2. Read `profile/directions.md` for #energy category goals.

## Context Loading

1. **Read last 14 daily notes via MCP** to track energy patterns
2. **Search for energy-related notes:**
   - `search_notes(query: "energy tired exhausted", searchType: "vector", limit: 10)`
   - `search_notes(query: "累 疲惫 精力", limit: 10)`
   - `search_notes(query: "exercise health sleep", limit: 10)`
   - `search_notes(query: "运动 健康 睡眠", limit: 10)`

## The Four Energy Dimensions

### 1. Physical Energy
- Sleep quality and quantity
- Exercise frequency
- Nutrition patterns
- Illness or physical complaints
- Weight/fitness trajectory

### 2. Mental Energy
- Focus and concentration quality
- Learning vs. routine work ratio
- Cognitive load from context-switching
- Creative output vs. administrative tasks

### 3. Emotional Energy
- Relationship quality (energizing vs. draining interactions)
- Stress sources
- Joy sources
- Unresolved conflicts or anxieties

### 4. Social Energy
- Introvert/extrovert battery level
- Quality of professional relationships
- Community connection
- Isolation signals

## Energy Matrix

Present findings as:

| Dimension | Sources (+) | Drains (-) | Net Trend |
|-----------|------------|------------|-----------|
| Physical | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Mental | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Emotional | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |
| Social | [what energizes] | [what drains] | ↑ ↓ → |

## Coaching Questions

1. "Which dimension is most depleted right now?"
2. "What's one energy drain you could eliminate this week?"
3. "What energizes you that you're not doing enough of?"
4. "Is any goal consuming disproportionate energy relative to its importance?" (Apply Pareto)

## Write-Back

Check for existing `#ai-reflection` content in today's daily note.
- If none: Before presenting the write-back, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel to verify citation accuracy, framing, and tone. Fix any issues they surface. **Write-backs are always in English.** Append energy audit summary using this format:
  ```
  ## [Descriptive Title] #ai-reflection #energy-audit
  [2-3 sentence summary of energy findings and one actionable change]
  Related: [[Note Title 1]] [[Note Title 2]]
  ```
  **Title guidelines:** The heading must describe the audit's core finding — not just "Energy Audit." Good examples:
  - `## Physical strong but socially drained #ai-reflection #energy-audit`
  - `## Energy dip: mental fatigue from context-switching #ai-reflection #energy-audit`
  - `## Sleep deficit dragging overall energy #ai-reflection #energy-audit`

  Never use generic titles like "Energy Audit Summary." The `#ai-reflection` tag already marks the content as AI-generated.

- If exists: skip.
