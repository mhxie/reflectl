# Introspect

Build or refresh your self-model by examining your Reflect notes, session history, and reading patterns. Produces three profile files that the rest of the system consults.

Unlike `/index` (mechanical extraction), `/introspect` discovers patterns: what you're drawn to, how your taste is shifting, where your curiosity is orbiting before you've named it as a goal.

## Prerequisites

Verify the Reflect MCP server is accessible by calling `list_tags`. If it fails with a connection error, tell the user: "Cannot reach Reflect MCP server. Make sure Reflect is running and the MCP server is enabled."

## Output Files

```
profile/
├── identity.md      — who you are + intellectual taste + curiosity vectors
├── directions.md    — era, goals, quarterly focus, active directions
└── expertise.md     — domain knowledge, research taste, known biases
```

`reader_persona.md` (at repo root) is a raw input signal, not a profile output. Built separately by `/build-persona` from Readwise data.

## Pipeline

### Step 1: Gather Raw Material

Run these searches in parallel:

**Goals & Directions:**
1. `search_notes(query: "目标", limit: 20)` — Chinese goal notes
2. `search_notes(query: "goal", limit: 20)` — English goal notes
3. `search_notes(query: "小目标", limit: 20)` — Annual goal notes
4. `search_notes(query: "objective", limit: 10)` — Additional goal notes

**Identity & Themes:**
5. `list_tags()` — categorization system
6. `search_notes(query: "career", limit: 10)` — Career trajectory
7. `search_notes(query: "职业", limit: 10)` — Chinese career notes
8. `search_notes(query: "learning", limit: 10)` — Learning interests
9. `search_notes(query: "学习", limit: 10)` — Chinese learning notes

**Recent Context:**
10. `get_daily_note(date: "<today>")` — today
11. `get_daily_note(date: "<yesterday>")` — yesterday
12. `search_notes(query: "plan", editedAfter: "<30 days ago>", limit: 10)` — recent planning

Deduplicate results by note ID. Prioritize recent notes.

### Step 2: Read Full Content

For the top ~30-40 most relevant notes, read full content using `get_note(noteId: "<id>")`. Focus on:
- All goal notes (critical for directions.md)
- Recent daily notes (critical for identity.md — taste and curiosity signals)
- Top career/learning notes

### Step 3: Discover Taste & Curiosity (NEW — not in old /index)

This step goes beyond mechanical extraction. Look for:

**Intellectual taste** (what you engage deeply with vs. skim):
- Topics that recur across daily notes without being declared goals
- Articles/papers you chose to deep-read vs. archive (check triage files in `sources/cache/triage-*.md`)
- Discussion tangents that repeatedly surface in reflection sessions
- Aesthetic preferences in how you evaluate ideas (from research-profile patterns)

**Curiosity vectors** (areas orbiting but not yet goals):
- Topics mentioned 3+ times in recent notes that aren't in current goals
- Reading saves that cluster around an unnamed theme
- Questions you keep asking but haven't formalized

**If `reader_persona.md` exists**, read it as a secondary signal — it shows what you save (behavioral), not what you think about (intentional). Note divergences between Readwise patterns and Reflect patterns.

### Step 4: Synthesize Profile Files

Using all gathered content, write three files:

**`profile/identity.md`** — who you are + taste + curiosity:
```markdown
# Identity
Last built: YYYY-MM-DD

## Who You Are
[2-3 sentence summary — role, interests, life stage]

## Active Life Areas
[Bullet points for each major area]

## Major Themes
[Recurring topics — what does this person think about most?]

## Intellectual Taste
[What you find interesting, elegant, and worth your time — independent of goals.
Built from session patterns and reading engagement.]

## Curiosity Vectors
[Areas you're starting to orbit but haven't formalized as goals yet.
Detected from session patterns, reading saves, and discussion tangents.]

## Key People
[Important people referenced frequently]

## Recent Focus (last 30 days)
[What you've been writing about recently]
```

**`profile/directions.md`** — era, goals, focus:
```markdown
# Directions
Last built: YYYY-MM-DD

## Era
[Current era, theme, primary/secondary directions, quarterly focus]

## Near-term (next 1-3 months)
[Goals with specific metrics — Source: [[Note Title]]]

## Mid-term (3-12 months)
[Goals from annual planning notes]

## Long-term (1-3 years)
[Career/life direction from strategic planning]

## Stale Goals (>1 year old, may need review)
[Goals from notes not edited recently]
```

**`profile/expertise.md`** — domain knowledge, research taste:
- Only update if new evidence warrants it (new reviews, new domain exposure)
- Follow the update guidelines already in the file
- Don't downgrade expertise without multiple data points

### Step 5: Quality Gate — Profile Validation

Before writing profile files, dispatch **Reviewer** + **Challenger** in parallel:

- **Reviewer** spot-checks 3-5 claims in the draft profile against source notes via `get_note()`:
  - Are cited [[Note Titles]] real and accurately represented?
  - Do "Intellectual Taste" claims have evidence in the notes, or are they fabricated?
  - Are goal statuses (progressing/stale) consistent with note edit dates?
  - Score using Session Review rubric (Citation Accuracy + Honesty dimensions only)
- **Challenger** probes the profile for blind spots:
  - Are curiosity vectors genuinely emerging, or just noise from 1-2 notes?
  - Does the profile overweight recent notes and miss long-term patterns?
  - Are there important life areas absent from the profile entirely?

If Reviewer scores < 7 on either dimension, fix the specific issues before writing. Present the validated profile to the user before saving — the user confirms or corrects.

### Step 6: Check for Divergences

Compare the three profile layers and flag tensions:
- Identity taste says X, but directions don't include it → potential emerging goal?
- Reader persona (Readwise) shows heavy saves in area Y, but no Reflect notes → consuming but not processing?
- Expertise is deep in area Z, but no current goals reference it → dormant strength?

Present divergences to the user — these are the interesting findings.

### Step 7: Report

Tell the user what you found:
- How many notes were queried
- Key themes identified
- **Taste and curiosity discoveries** (the new part)
- Any divergences between layers
- Suggest running `/reflect` to start using the profile
