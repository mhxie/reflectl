# Session Continuity

Defines how sessions connect across conversations so insights compound rather than reset.

## The Continuity Chain

Each session should feel like a chapter in an ongoing conversation, not a standalone event.

### Reading the Thread

At the start of every session, load:
1. **Last 3 reflection/review files** from `reflections/`
2. **Index files** (meta-summary.md, goals.md)
3. **Today's daily note** (current context)

This gives the session a "previously on..." anchor.

### Connecting Back

Every session should include at least one reference to a previous session:
- "Last time we talked about X. Has anything changed?"
- "In your last review, Y was flagged as neglected. Let's check in on that."
- "You set an intention last session to Z. How did that go?"

### Carrying Forward

Every session should plant a seed for the next:
- **Next Action:** Specific, actionable, time-bound
- **Open Question:** Something to sit with between sessions
- **Review Date:** When to revisit a decision or check progress

## File-Based Memory

Sessions leave artifacts that future sessions can read:

| File | Purpose | Read By |
|------|---------|---------|
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-reflection.md` | Daily insights | Next reflect session |
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-review.md` | Goal progress | Next review session |
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-weekly.md` | Weekly patterns | Next weekly session |
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-decision-*.md` | Decision records | Future decision/review sessions |
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-exploration.md` | Open threads | Next explore session |
| `reflections/YYYY-MM-DD-energy-audit.md` | Energy patterns | Next energy audit |
| `index/meta-summary.md` | User profile | Every session |
| `index/goals.md` | Goals | Every goal-related session |

## Cadence Recommendations

| Command | Recommended Frequency | Why |
|---------|---------------------|-----|
| `/project:reflect` | Daily or every 2-3 days | Maintains awareness of current thinking |
| `/project:weekly` | Weekly (Sunday or Monday) | Energy and attention patterns need a week of data |
| `/project:review` | Monthly | Goals change slowly; more frequent reviews are noise |
| `/project:decision` | As needed | When facing a real decision |
| `/project:explore` | Weekly or when feeling stuck | Keeps serendipity alive |
| `/project:energy-audit` | Monthly or after high-stress periods | Energy patterns are slow-moving |
| `/project:index` | Monthly or after major life change | Index needs fresh data when context shifts significantly |

## Continuity Anti-Patterns

1. **Groundhog Day**: Every session starts from zero with no reference to previous sessions. Fix: Always read recent reflections first.
2. **Nostalgia Trap**: Spending too long on what was discussed before and not enough on what's new. Fix: One callback, then move forward.
3. **Orphaned Intentions**: Setting "next actions" that never get checked. Fix: Explicitly check last session's intention at the start.
4. **Overloaded Sessions**: Trying to do reflect + review + weekly all at once. Fix: One command per session.
