# Error Handling & Graceful Degradation

Defines how agents handle failures without blocking sessions.

## Failure Hierarchy

Failures are ranked by severity. Handle at the lowest level possible.

### Level 1: Recoverable (handle silently)
- Single MCP search returns empty → try alternative query
- Note content is shorter than expected → use what's available
- Framework file missing → skip framework, use first principles
- Previous reflection file missing → treat as first session

### Level 2: Degraded (warn and continue)
- MCP server unreachable → fall back to cached index files only
- Index files stale (>7 days) → warn user, proceed with stale data
- Multiple searches return empty → report coverage gap, continue with available data
- Write-back to Reflect fails → save locally, inform user

### Level 3: Blocking (stop and inform)
- No profile files AND no MCP connection → cannot proceed, guide user to fix
- All goal data missing → cannot run review, suggest `/introspect`
- Fundamental prompt misunderstanding → ask user to clarify

## Agent-Specific Fallbacks

### Researcher
- **MCP down**: Read `profile/identity.md` and `profile/directions.md` as sole sources. Prefix output with `[DEGRADED: MCP unavailable, using cached index only]`
- **Empty results**: Try 3 alternative queries before reporting gap. Query strategy: exact → semantic → broader category
- **Rate limited**: Batch remaining queries, report partial results

### Synthesizer
- **No research brief received**: Read index files directly (bypass normal contract). Note: `[DEGRADED: No research brief, synthesizing from index only]`
- **Research brief has critical gaps**: Acknowledge gaps explicitly in output rather than filling with speculation
- **Write failure**: Save to `reflections/` locally, skip Reflect write-back

### Reviewer
- **Cannot verify citation**: Mark as `UNVERIFIED` rather than `FAIL`. Distinguish "wrong" from "couldn't check"
- **profile/directions.md missing**: Skip goal coverage check, note in output
- **MCP down during spot-check**: Use grep on local files as fallback

### Challenger
- **No recent daily notes**: Use latest reflection file as context instead
- **No contradictions found**: This is fine — not every session has contradictions. Don't force them.
- **User emotional state unclear**: Default to neutral register

### Thinker
- **Framework files missing**: Use built-in knowledge of frameworks (they're well-known models)
- **Web search fails**: Proceed without external sources, note the limitation
- **No clear framework fit**: Use first principles thinking — always available

### Curator
- **Content loss in merge**: Run Content Preservation Checklist (see `curator.md`). Scan source notes for `![`, `http`, `[[`, table syntax before finalizing. If any media is found in sources but missing from output, block the proposal until fixed.
- **create_note produces empty note (silent failure)**: The parameter is `contentMarkdown`, not `content`. After every `create_note` call, verify with `get_note` that the body is non-empty. If empty: the wrong parameter was used. Fix the parameter name and retry with a new title (the empty note now occupies the original title and cannot be overwritten or deleted via API).
- **create_note returns existing note**: This means the title conflicts. Inform the user — they must either choose a different title or manually edit in Reflect.
- **Merge mistake after creation**: Cannot fix via API. Create a corrected note with an amended title (e.g., "Title v2") and inform the user to delete the bad one manually.
- **Partial note read failure**: If any source note in a merge fails to load, abort the merge. Do not proceed with partial sources.
- **Note deleted before processing**: Always cache source notes locally before processing (see Curator's fetch-and-cache step). If a source note disappears mid-session, use the local cache. If no cache exists, abort and warn — the content may be unrecoverable.
- **Size overflow**: The Reflect API times out at ~20KB. Use 15KB as the working limit — split notes into parts at 15KB with cross-link headers. Never attempt to create a note you estimate will exceed 15KB.
- **Image/media count mismatch**: If the output media count does not match the source media count, the proposal is invalid. Re-scan cached sources and fix before presenting to user.

### Evolver
- **Cannot write to files**: Report proposed changes as text diff for manual application
- **Git operations fail**: Propose changes without committing
- **Conflicting improvement signals**: Document the tension, don't force resolution

## Session Continuity

If a session is interrupted:
1. Check `reflections/` for partial output from today
2. Check daily note for `#ai-reflection` content already written
3. Resume from the last completed step rather than restarting
4. If unclear what was done, ask the user

## Timeout Policy

- MCP calls: 30 seconds before fallback
- Web searches: 15 seconds before skip
- Agent handoffs: No timeout (rely on maxTurns)
- Write operations: 10 seconds, then save locally
