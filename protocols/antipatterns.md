## Antipatterns Catalog

Named failure modes that slip past presence-oriented review. Used by the Reviewer (System Diff and System Holistic modes) and the Evolver (Decide phase) on Tier 2+ changes, because evasion is easier when nobody has to name the class of thing they just bypassed.

## How to use in a review

For each antipattern below, write one of:
- `FLAG: <file:line> - <specific finding>`
- `N/A: <one-line reason this change does not touch this class>`

Silent skips are not allowed. A non-trivial change with zero FLAGs and zero justified N/As is itself a rubber-stamp (see `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` -> Adversarial Mandate).

## What a FLAG means

A FLAG is a SHOULD-FIX concern at minimum. It does not auto-block; the Reviewer composes the per-FLAG severity using the Detect criterion plus the change context, then routes through the standard concern list (BLOCKER / SHOULD-FIX / NICE-TO-HAVE) feeding the system review verdict (`.claude/agents/reviewer.md` -> Scoring -> System Review).

When a FLAG fires:
1. **Reviewer:** record severity in the concern list with `file:line`. The Remediate line on the matching catalog entry is the default fix path; deviate only with a one-line reason in the concern entry.
2. **Evolver:** if running the self-check before dispatching the Reviewer, do not silently downgrade a FLAG to N/A; surface it in the handoff so the Reviewer sees the same evidence.
3. **Orchestrator:** treat unresolved BLOCKER FLAGs as a verdict floor breach (forces NEEDS_REVISION). SHOULD-FIX and NICE-TO-HAVE FLAGs surface in the synthesis but do not by themselves block the verdict if the rest of the rubric clears.

## When required

| Tier | Antipattern scan |
|------|------------------|
| 1 (single-file fix) | Optional |
| 2+ (multi-file, protocol, agent, or command changes) | Required |

## Catalog

### 1. Premature abstraction
Introduces a helper, base class, or protocol contract before 3+ concrete call sites exist.
- Detect: new abstraction has fewer than 3 call sites in the same commit.
- Remediate: inline the first 2-3 uses; extract only when the third use confirms the shape.

### 2. Rule duplication
The same rule lives in CLAUDE.md, an agent file, and a protocol simultaneously.
- Detect: grep a noun phrase from the new rule across `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/`, `protocols/`. More than one hit for the same instruction is a flag.
- Remediate: keep the rule in the most specific location (agent > command > protocol > CLAUDE.md). Cross-reference, do not duplicate.

### 3. Happy-path-only design
Describes success but not failure modes, timeouts, missing inputs, or concurrent access.
- Detect: no section, table, or line addresses what happens when preconditions fail.
- Remediate: name the top 2 failure modes and what the system does about each.

### 4. Implicit contracts
References a type, agent, tool, handoff field, or protocol that is not defined in the current diff or already in the repo.
- Detect: grep each referenced symbol; absence is an implicit contract.
- Remediate: define it in the same change or drop the reference.

### 5. Monotonic growth
Adds a rule, file, or step without identifying what could be retired.
- Detect: net line count strictly positive across `protocols/` + `.claude/agents/` + `CLAUDE.md`, with no deletions.
- Remediate: name what this subsumes or replaces. If genuinely additive, state why nothing could be removed.

### 6. Shadow state
The same fact or threshold is encoded in two or more places.
- Detect: numeric thresholds, file paths, tier counts, model IDs, or scoring cutoffs appearing in multiple files.
- Remediate: one source of truth; others cross-reference.

### 7. Behavior coupled to location
Assumes "if it lives in directory X it will be treated as Y" without enforcement.
- Detect: directory-based semantics (`$ZK/wiki/`, `zk/cache/`, `$ZK/reflections/`) without a script or guard that checks them.
- Remediate: add a `scripts/` check, or document the coupling explicitly so it is visible to future changes.

### 8. Scope creep past the stated criterion
The diff includes changes unrelated to the success criterion the Evolver or user stated.
- Detect: files or edits that do not serve the stated criterion.
- Remediate: split into a separate change, or fold back to criterion-only edits.

### 9. Placebo guard
A script, hook, or check runs but does not catch the thing it claims to catch.
- Detect: the guard has no known-failing input in its own test or history; its logic silently passes on missing, empty, or malformed input.
- Remediate: add a known-bad input case, or a fail-loud branch for empty/missing input.
