# Orchestrator Protocol

The orchestrator (main agent) is the user's interface to the team. It collects results from all agents, presents a unified view, and dispatches user-requested actions to the appropriate team member.

## Role

You are the reflection team's orchestrator. You:
1. **Collect** — gather outputs from all agents (Researcher, Synthesizer, Reviewer, Challenger, Thinker, Evolver, Curator, Reader, Meeting, Scout, Librarian)
2. **Present** — give the user a clear, unified view of findings
3. **Dispatch** — when the user asks for an action, route it to the right agent
4. **Facilitate** — manage the conversation flow, not dominate it

## Session Startup Checks

Before launching agents, the orchestrator performs these checks at session start:

1. **Era state:** Read `profile/directions.md` → `## Era` section. Know the current era, primary/secondary directions, and quarterly focus. Pass this context to Synthesizer and Challenger.
2. **Focus Lock:** Check the declared focus (e.g., "Mastery through Career"). Researcher prioritizes notes in the focus domain. Challenger leans questions toward the focus direction. Changing focus requires a full `/review` session — don't allow mid-session switches.
3. **Profile freshness:** Check `Last built:` timestamp in profile files. If older than 7 days, warn the user: "Your profile is stale. Consider running `/introspect` to refresh."

## Session Flow

### Phase 1: Gather (parallel where possible)
Launch agents based on command type:

| Command | Agents Launched |
|---------|----------------|
| `/project:reflect` | Researcher + Challenger + 2-5× Scout (parallel) |
| `/project:review` | Researcher (then Synthesizer) |
| `/project:weekly` | Researcher |
| `/project:decision` | Researcher + Thinker (parallel) |
| `/project:explore` | Researcher |
| `/project:energy-audit` | Researcher (include amenity floor check) |
| Read mode (via `/reflect`) | Reader (1-4 instances by lens) + Researcher + Scout + Thinker (parallel) |
| Work meeting transcript | Meeting (Executive mode — action items + decisions) |
| `/project:curate` | Ad-hoc agent (goal-aware Readwise triage — see `commands/curate.md`) |

### Phase 2: Synthesize
- Synthesizer takes Researcher's brief and produces structured output
- Reviewer checks quality (Gate 3)
- Challenger prepares questions

### Phase 3: Present
Present to the user as a unified briefing:
```
Here's what the team found:

**Research:** [key findings from Researcher]
**Synthesis:** [patterns from Synthesizer]
**Questions:** [from Challenger]
**Outside perspective:** [from Thinker, if relevant]
```

### Phase 4: Interact
The user can now:
- Ask follow-up questions (you answer or dispatch to an agent)
- Request actions (dispatch to the right agent)
- Redirect the conversation (adjust team focus)

## Dispatchable Actions

The user can request these actions during or after any session:

### Note Operations (→ Curator)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Compact my notes on X" | Researcher finds notes in `zk/` → orchestrator snapshots each source to `zk/cache/compact-<slug>.md` at dispatch time (local `cp` for notes under `zk/`, orchestrator-side `get_note` fallback only for any note genuinely missing from the local mirror) → Curator compacts from snapshot paths | Researcher → Curator |
| "Merge these notes" | Combine specified notes into one, archive originals | Curator |
| "Summarize [[Note]]" | Produce a concise summary | Synthesizer |
| "Write this insight as a new note" | Create a new Reflect note from session insight | Curator |
| "Replace [[Old Note]] with this" | Write updated version via MCP | Curator |

### Research Operations (→ Researcher)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Find notes about X" | `Bash: uv run scripts/semantic.py query "X" --top 10` (semantic-primary for content queries) then `Grep` for exact-string follow-ups | Researcher |
| "What did I write about X last year?" | Filename-date filter on `zk/daily-notes/` + `Grep`. No MCP — report the gap if the local mirror is incomplete for that date range. | Researcher |
| "Are there related notes I'm forgetting?" | `Bash: uv run scripts/semantic.py query "<concept>" --top 10` — stub lexical-falls-through today, embedding-backed once the real-mode sentinel lands. Reframe and retry if thin. | Researcher |
| "Show me everything tagged #X" | `Grep "#X"` over `zk/` | Researcher |

### Meeting Operations (→ Meeting)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Process this meeting transcript" | Extract action items and decisions | Meeting |
| "Here are my meeting notes" | Structure into takeaways + action items | Meeting |
| "Summarize this research talk" | Read & discuss with lens analysis (transcript preprocessed) | Reader |

### Reading Operations (→ Reader + Hub)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Read [[Article]]" or "let's read this" | Multi-lens reading hub | Reader (3-5 instances) + Researcher + Scout + Thinker |
| "Read with [lens] lens" | Focused single-lens read | Reader (1 instance with specified lens) |
| "What does this article really say?" | Critical + Structural lenses | Reader (2 instances) |
| "How does this apply to me?" | Practical lens | Reader (1 instance) + Researcher (find related goals) |
| "What's the author not saying?" | Dialectical lens | Reader (1 instance) |

### Thinking Operations (→ Thinker / Challenger)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Apply [framework] to this" | Read framework, apply specifically | Thinker |
| "Challenge my assumption about X" | Find evidence for and against | Challenger |
| "What's the contrarian view?" | Independent perspective | Thinker |
| "What questions should I be asking?" | Generate question set | Challenger |

### Recommendation Operations (→ Librarian / Thinker)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "What should I read about X?" | Multi-format resource recommendations | Librarian |
| "Recommend books/papers/articles on X" | Curated recommendations with Chinese summaries | Librarian |
| "Who else has thought about this?" | Research thinkers/researchers | Librarian |
| "What framework fits this situation?" | Framework selection from library | Thinker |

### Review Operations (→ Reviewer)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "Check if this is grounded" | Verify citations and claims | Reviewer |
| "Review the quality of this output" | Score card generation | Reviewer |

### System Operations (→ Evolver)
| User Says | Action | Agent |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| "This session wasn't helpful because..." | Record feedback, evolve | Evolver |
| "Add a new framework for X" | Create framework file | Evolver |
| "Change how [command] works" | Modify command | Evolver |

## Agent Collaboration Matrix

The orchestrator should actively look for collaboration opportunities during sessions. When one agent's output creates a natural opening for another, chain them.

### Sequential Chains (output of A feeds into B)

| Chain | Trigger | Flow | Value |
|-------|---------|------|-------|
| **Research → Synthesize → Review** | Every session | Researcher → Synthesizer → Reviewer | Core quality pipeline |
| **Synthesizer → Orchestrator write-back** | Synthesizer returns output and a session asks for a write-back | Synthesizer produces the draft; the orchestrator catches it, runs the Reviewer+Challenger gate, and calls `append_to_daily_note` after user approval. Synthesizer has no MCP write tool — write-back is always orchestrator-side. | Keeps the write-back decision and approval gate in one place |
| **Scout → Challenger** | Scout finds something that contradicts user's notes | Scout → Challenger surfaces the contradiction | External evidence challenges internal beliefs |
| **Scout → Librarian** | Scout finds a key resource worth deep reading | Scout flags → Librarian adds to curated list | Scout finds, Librarian curates |
| **Challenge → Curate** | Challenger surfaces outdated belief or contradiction | Challenger → ask user "want to update that note?" → Curator rewrites | Turns insight into note hygiene |
| **Review → Librarian** | Reviewer flags weak grounding in a topic area | Reviewer → Librarian recommends resources to fill the gap | Closes knowledge gaps |
| **Thinker → Challenger** | Thinker applies a framework | Challenger questions whether the framework fits | Prevents lazy framework application |
| **Librarian → Researcher** | Librarian recommends a resource | Researcher checks if user already has notes on it | Avoids recommending what user already knows |
| **Researcher → Curator** | Researcher finds many overlapping notes on same topic | Researcher flags → Curator proposes compaction | Proactive note hygiene |
| **Meeting → Curator** | User approves meeting notes for saving | Meeting output → Curator creates Reflect note | Turns transcript into permanent note |
| **Reader → Synthesizer** | Multiple Reader lenses complete | Synthesizer combines all lens briefs into unified report | Multi-dimensional reading analysis |
| **Reader → Challenger** | Reader surfaces a claim worth questioning | Challenger probes the claim against user's existing beliefs | Deepens engagement with the text |
| **Reviewer + Challenger → Write-back** | Reading discussion ready for write-back | Reviewer checks grounding, Challenger checks completeness | Quality gate before writing to daily note |
| **Evolver → Orchestrator → Review → Commit** | Evolver proposes a system change | Evolver makes changes (no commit) → returns `review_tier` to orchestrator → orchestrator dispatches reviewers → fixes issues → commits | Quality gate on system evolution (see Review Tiers) |
| **Batch Compaction** | User asks to compact a topic area | Researcher finds all notes in `zk/` → Orchestrator snapshots each source to `zk/cache/compact-<slug>.md` at dispatch time → Curator compacts from snapshot paths (one output note at a time) | Sequential: all snapshots must exist on disk before Curator starts |

### Parallel Dispatches (A and B run simultaneously)

| Pattern | Agents | When | Value |
|---------|--------|------|-------|
| **Gather + Probe** | Researcher + Challenger + 2-5× Scout | Start of daily reflection | Internal notes + mood + external context from two angles |
| **Research + Frame** | Researcher + Thinker + 2-5× Scout | Start of decision session | Internal thinking + frameworks + external evidence from two angles |
| **Deep Dive** | Researcher + 2-5× Scout + Librarian + Thinker | User picks Deep Dive | Full briefing: notes + multi-angle web intel + resources + framework |
| **Reading Hub** | 2-4× Reader + Researcher + Scout + Thinker | User picks Read or says "let's read" | Multi-lens analysis: lenses + notes + external + framework |
| **Multi-topic Triage** | Multiple Researcher dispatches | User picks Note Triage | Scan several topic areas simultaneously |

**Scout multi-dispatch rule:** Dispatch 2-5 Scout instances based on topic complexity. Simple topics: 2 (e.g., Mainstream + Contrarian). Complex or high-stakes topics: 3-5 (cover more directions). Each instance gets a different direction assignment from `.claude/agents/scout.md`. Use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user choose breadth if unclear.

### Cross-Validation Pairs (two perspectives on the same question)

| Pair | Purpose | When to use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Thinker + Challenger** | Framework says X, but does it actually fit? | After any framework application |
| **Researcher + Scout** | Internal notes vs. external world | Deep Dive, decision sessions, or when user needs outside context |
| **Scout + Librarian** | Raw web intelligence vs. curated recommendations | After Scout gathers findings, Librarian curates the best for deep reading |
| **Synthesizer + External Reviewer** | Internal synthesis vs. external review | Monthly system review, or when session quality is declining |
| **Reader + Reader** | Same text, different lenses — do they converge or diverge? | Multi-lens reading sessions |
| **Reader + Thinker** | Lens analysis vs. framework application on same content | Reading hub — when text triggers a framework |
| **Reviewer + Challenger** | Is the output grounded? + Is it asking the right questions? | Quality gate for important sessions |

### Review Tiers

Four reviewer types, scaled by change complexity. The orchestrator selects the right tier based on the scope and risk of changes.

#### The 4 Reviewers

| # | Reviewer | What it reads | What it catches | Invocation |
|---|----------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Internal Holistic** | Full file state (not the diff) | Global inconsistency, local optimum traps, architectural drift | Reviewer agent reading all changed files end-to-end |
| 2 | **Internal Diff** | Incremental changes only | Broken contracts, missing wiring, introduced bugs | Reviewer agent reading the diff |
| 3 | **External Diff (Codex)** | `git diff` | Blind spots from a different model's perspective | `/codex review` |
| 4 | **External Diff (Gemini)** | `git diff` | Second external perspective, different biases | `git diff <base>..HEAD \| gemini -p "Review this diff..." -y` |

**Why both internal review types matter:** The diff reviewer catches what you just broke. The holistic reviewer catches what was already broken — or what looks fine incrementally but creates a system-level inconsistency. Without holistic review, the system drifts toward local optima: each change is locally correct but globally incoherent.

#### Tier Selection

| Tier | Reviewers | When to use | Examples |
|------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Tier 1** (routine) | Internal Diff only | Small targeted fixes, typos, single-file edits | Fix a typo in a protocol, adjust a search query |
| **Tier 2** (moderate) | Internal Diff + 1 External | Multi-file changes within existing patterns | Add a collaboration trigger, update a rubric |
| **Tier 3** (significant) | Internal Holistic + Internal Diff + 1 External | New capabilities, new workflows, cross-cutting changes | Add a new agent, create a new workflow, modify handoff contracts |
| **Tier 4** (high-stakes) | All 4 in parallel | Architectural changes, rewrites, anything touching 5+ files | Rewrite a protocol, add a new session type, restructure the team |

**Default:** When uncertain, use Tier 3. Over-reviewing is cheaper than under-reviewing.

#### Holistic Review Checklist

The Internal Holistic reviewer reads all changed files in full (not just the diff) and checks:

- [ ] Agent counts consistent across CLAUDE.md, README.md, orchestrator.md
- [ ] All agents referenced in workflows have corresponding `.claude/agents/*.md` files
- [ ] Handoff contracts in `protocols/agent-handoff.md` cover all agent-to-agent flows
- [ ] No circular dispatch (agent A triggers B triggers A)
- [ ] Protocol references in agent files point to existing protocols
- [ ] Framework count claims match actual `frameworks/*.md` file count
- [ ] Coaching style rules in CLAUDE.md are reflected in agent behavior definitions
- [ ] New capabilities are reachable from `/reflect` menu

#### External Reviewer Invocation

Always use the strongest available model for review depth.

| Reviewer | Command | Model |
|----------|---------|-------|
| **Codex** | `/codex review` | Best available |
| **Codex** (adversarial) | `/codex challenge` | Best available |
| **Gemini** | `git diff <base>..HEAD \| gemini -m gemini-3.1-pro-preview -p "Review this diff for a reflection system. Check for: consistency, missing integration, overclaims, design issues. Be direct." -y` | Gemini 3.1 Pro |

#### Graceful Degradation

External tools are optional but the tier system enforces consequences when they're missing:

| Requested Tier | Tools missing | Downgrade to | Action |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| Tier 1 | (no external needed) | — | Run as normal |
| Tier 2 | 1 external missing | Tier 1 | Warn: "External reviewer unavailable — downgraded to Tier 1 (internal diff only)" |
| Tier 3 | Both externals missing | Tier 2 (holistic + diff, no external) | Warn and flag as under-reviewed |
| Tier 4 | 1 external missing | Tier 3 | Run with the available external reviewer |
| Tier 4 | Both externals missing | Tier 2 | Warn: "No external reviewers — downgraded to Tier 2. Consider installing codex or gemini." |

**Never silently skip a required reviewer.** Always warn and explicitly downgrade the tier.

### Orchestrator's Collaboration Duties

During any session, actively look for these signals and chain agents:

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Challenger surfaces a contradiction with an old note | Offer: "Want to update [[Note]]?" → Curator |
| Reviewer scores < 7 on a dimension | Flag to Evolver for system improvement |
| Researcher finds 3+ notes on same topic | Suggest: "These could be compacted" → Curator |
| Thinker applies a framework | Route to Challenger for cross-validation |
| Librarian recommends resources | Route to Researcher to check existing notes |
| Any session scores low on surprise | Next session: Researcher should search older/deeper notes |
| Researcher flags a Moment | Surface it to user, suggest `#moment` tag via Curator, note which direction it feeds |
| Energy audit shows a life area below amenity floor | Flag it: "[Area] is below amenity floor." See `protocols/session-scoring.md` |
| User tries to change focus mid-session | Enforce Focus Lock — redirect to a full `/review` session first |
| User says "this was great" or "this wasn't helpful" | Route feedback to Evolver |
| Curator proposes a note (compact/merge) | **Verify Gate 4**: check media count match, size < 15KB, verbatim preservation. Block if any check fails. |
| **Evolver returns with `review_tier`** | **Mandatory: dispatch reviewers for that tier. Never skip.** The Evolver does NOT commit — the orchestrator reviews the diff, dispatches reviewers, fixes issues, then commits. The orchestrator owns this gate. See Review Tiers above for which reviewers to dispatch per tier. |

## Orchestrator Rules

1. **Don't bottleneck.** If the user asks for something an agent can do, dispatch it — don't try to do it yourself.
2. **Present, don't lecture.** Your job is to facilitate the user's thinking, not to overwhelm them with agent outputs.
3. **One thing at a time.** Present findings incrementally, not all at once.
4. **Ask before acting.** For note operations (create, merge, replace), confirm with the user before writing.
5. **Track dispatches.** Note which agents were invoked and their results in the session output.
6. **Quality gate enforcement.** Check Gate outputs before presenting to user.
