# Quality Gates

Defines checkpoints that must pass before output reaches the user. Each gate has clear pass/fail criteria and a remediation path.

## Gate Architecture

```
[Research] → Gate 1 → [Synthesis] → Gate 2 → [Review] → Gate 3 → [User]
                                       ↑                    |
                                       └── Revision Loop ←──┘

[Curator Proposal] → Gate 4 → [User Approval] → [create_note]
```

## Gate 1: Research Completeness

**When:** After Researcher finishes, before Synthesizer starts.

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Source count | >= 5 relevant notes found | Try alternative search queries |
| Language coverage | Both Chinese and English searched | Run missing language queries |
| Recency | At least 2 notes from last 30 days | Expand time range, note staleness |
| Gap acknowledgment | Gaps explicitly listed | Researcher must document gaps |
| Handoff format | Valid `---handoff---` block present | Researcher must format output |

**Gate keeper:** Orchestrator (main agent)
**Max retries:** 1 (if fail, proceed with degraded flag)

## Gate 2: Synthesis Quality

**When:** After Synthesizer finishes, before Reviewer starts.

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Citation density | >= 80% of claims have [[citations]] | Flag unsourced claims for review |
| Insight level | At least 1 Pattern/Tension/Implication level insight | Synthesizer must deepen |
| Goal coverage | All active categories mentioned or explained | Address missing categories |
| Language matching | Chinese sources → Chinese sections | Fix language mismatches |
| Source audit | Source audit block present at end | Synthesizer must add it |

**Gate keeper:** Orchestrator (main agent)
**Max retries:** 1

## Gate 3: Review Pass

**When:** After Reviewer scores, before presenting to user.

Session and system reviews use different thresholds. System reviews are stricter because system changes compound across every future session while session reviews affect only one output. Canonical rubric lives in `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` (Scoring); this gate cites the verdicts, it does not define them.

### Session Review (reflection and reading output)

| Overall Score | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| 8-10 | APPROVED: deliver to user |
| 6-7.9 | APPROVED_WITH_NOTES: deliver with caveats |
| 4-5.9 | NEEDS_REVISION: send back to Synthesizer with specific fixes (max 2 rounds) |
| 0-3.9 | REJECTED: start over or deliver with major caveats |

### System Review (Diff + Holistic modes)

Apply rows top-to-bottom; first match wins. NEEDS_REVISION is the catch-all default.

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Overall < 4 (catastrophic) | REJECTED: redesign |
| Overall >= 8.5 AND no dimension <6 AND all required artifacts present | APPROVED: orchestrator may commit |
| Otherwise (any dim <6, any artifact missing, or overall 4-8.4) | NEEDS_REVISION: fix and re-run |

No APPROVED_WITH_NOTES for system reviews. See `.claude/agents/reviewer.md` -> Scoring for why weighted passes with a low single dimension conceal real flaws.

**Gate keeper:** Reviewer
**Max revision rounds:** Session = 2 (after 2 failed revisions, deliver with all caveats). System = unlimited (Evolver may escalate to user after 2 rounds without progress).

## Gate 4: Note Operations (Compact/Merge)

**When:** After Curator produces a proposal, before presenting to user.

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Source snapshots | All source notes snapshotted to `zk/cache/<operation>-<slug>.md` at dispatch time (local copy for notes in `zk/`, MCP `get_note` fallback for missing ones) | Abort — do not draft from un-snapshotted sources |
| Media count match | Output image count = snapshot media count | Block — re-scan snapshot files, restore missing media |
| Size limit | Each output note < 15KB | Split into numbered parts before presenting |
| Verbatim preservation | Chinese text, interview memos, raw observations preserved word-for-word | Block — diff against snapshot files to find paraphrased content |
| Voice separation | External quotes (forum posts, others' experiences) clearly attributed | Block — add attribution markers |
| Factual accuracy | No conflation of different people's experiences or event sequences | Block — cross-check against snapshot files |
| Structured data | Pipelines, timelines, tracking tables preserved exactly | Block — copy from snapshot file |

**Gate keeper:** Orchestrator (verifies Curator's self-assessment in `content_integrity` field)
**Max retries:** 1 (if still failing, present to user with explicit warnings about what's missing)

## Gate 5: Profile Validation (/introspect)

**When:** After profile files are drafted, before writing to disk.

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Citation accuracy | Claims about user's taste/goals backed by real notes | Fix unsourced claims |
| Curiosity vector validity | Each vector has 3+ note references, not noise | Remove weak vectors |
| Completeness | No major life areas silently omitted | Add missing areas or explain gap |
| Profile consistency | No contradictions between identity, directions, and expertise | Resolve or flag as tension |

**Gate keeper:** Reviewer (Citation Accuracy + Honesty dimensions) + Challenger (blind spots)
**Max retries:** 1 (present to user with caveats if still failing)

## Gate 6: Deep Dive & Meeting Transcripts

**When:** Before write-back (Deep Dive) or before creating Reflect note (Meeting).

| Check | Pass Criteria | Fail Action |
|-------|--------------|-------------|
| Scout claims verified | External facts have source URLs | Remove or flag unverified claims |
| Action item attribution (Meeting) | Each action item has an owner | Challenger flags ambiguous items |
| No fabricated connections | Synthesizer didn't invent links between notes | Reviewer spot-checks |

**Gate keeper:** Reviewer + Challenger (Deep Dive), Challenger only (Meeting)
**Max retries:** 1

## Bypass Conditions

Gates can be bypassed when:
- MCP is unavailable (degraded mode — skip Gates 1 and portions of Gate 3)
- User explicitly asks for a quick/rough reflection
- Session is interactive and user is actively participating (lower bar for completeness)

## Gate Metrics

Track over time (stored in session output):
- Gate 1 pass rate
- Gate 2 pass rate
- Gate 3 average score
- Revision loop frequency
- Bypass frequency
